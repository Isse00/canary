# Additional Observations
observations:
  unexpected_behaviors: The Grafana & Promethius portion was not as straight forward as implied, the queries kept returning empty arrays.
  suggested_improvements: I would suggest adding a short walkthrough on Promethius and Grafana, how to test for valid values and write queries.
